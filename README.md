# Where is this going to take us?
We are creating a router. We don't know what is
going to look like. We don't know what features it
will have. This is a case of the blind leading the
blind.

## Development Style

- Write a test.
- Send to another developer.
- Write code to satify the test ONLY.
- Repeat.

If we follow this process the project will be
done when all the test are passing. This is an
expermint on abstracting the code from the test.
Should be fun. Ping me if you would like to join
up.
